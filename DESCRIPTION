Description: This dataset contains fertilizer management data from 129 farmers in the Ntonda Extension Planning Area (EPA) in Blantyre District in southern Malawi. Over a period of one week, farmers in different sections of the EPA were interviewed about their practices regarding maize cultivation. In addition, samples of both basal (NPK) and topdressing (urea) fertilizer were taken (`basal_fertilizer_grams` and `topdressing_fertilizer_grams`) to better understand how much fertilizer is used per planting station.
